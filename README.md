Courses in the Mathematics for Machine Learning from Imperial College London

This repository is comprised of my completed work for the Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera.
Some of the additional Jupyter notebooks in the course weeks are my own creation in order to help me visualize and understand better the material, and you are free to inspire yourself from them.
